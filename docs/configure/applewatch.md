# Connecting to an Apple Watch

There are currently two ways to show your BG information on your Apple Watch using xDrip4iOS.

Most people chose to use both methods as each one works well at certain times.

------

## Apple Watch App

**Prerequisite:** xDrip4iOS must be installed on your Watch.  
This should be automatically done when you install xDrip4iOS on your phone. 

If it isn't:

- Go to the Apple Watch app on your phone
- In the “My Watch” tab to scroll all the way down to the “Available apps” section
- Tap “Install” next to xDrip4iOS

</br>

The Watch App can be opened by just pressing the side button of your Watch and looking for the xDrip4iOS icon. Just press it to open the app:

To add a shortcut to the xDrip4iOS Watch app as a complication on a compatible watch face:

- Long press the watch face
- Tap “modify”
- Select the complication slot where you want to have it and scroll with the digital crown until xDrip4iOS is selected
- Press the crown to exit back to watchface

This shortcut/complication *will not* display BG values. It will just display the xDrip4iOS shortcut and allow you to quickly launch the app.

</br> 

Alternatively, this can be done from the Watch app on the iPhone.

Adding it to the dock, depends on the mode. If you have the Dock set to “most recent” then it simply depends on when you last opened xDrip4iOS whether it will appear or not. If you want it there permanently and in front, you must set it to “Favourites” mode. And “favourites” are managed from the Apple Watch app on the iPhone, you can add xDrip4iOS as a favorite there to have it in dock permanently.

## Calendar Complication Method

This is a more classic way used to display BG values in real-time on your Watch. It takes advantage of the Watch's ability to maintain a real-time sync of calendar events between the Watch and the iPhone.

This allows us to create calendar events on your iPhone from xDrip4iOS and have them instantly appear on the Watch. When we create a new event (due to having a new sensor value), the old event is automatically deleted from your calendar.

On your iPhone calendar create a new calendar and call it xDrip4iOS, xDrip, Glucose or whatever name you want.

<img src="../img/Calendar2.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

<img src="../img/Calendar3.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

In xDrip4iOS settings create an event in calendar to allow sync’ing with your Apple Watch. Authorize xDrip4iOS to have write permission to this calendar.

<img src="../img/AppleWatch1.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

Select the xDrip4iOS calendar (or whatever you called it).

<img src="../img/AppleWatch2.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

You can then customize the indications.
