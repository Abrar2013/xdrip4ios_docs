# Connecting to Smartwatches

xDrip4iOS can be used with several other types of popular smartwatches although the way of using them to see your data with change depending on the type of smartwatch used.

## Fitbit

[Nightscout](https://nightscout.github.io/nightscout/new_user/) required.

- Ionic, Sense, Versa 1/2/3 and Lite
- Glucose value, graphs and Nightscout careportal integration
- Internet connection and Nightscout needed

Once you have your BG data in Nightscout use a watchface like [these](https://nightscout.github.io/nightscout/wearable/#fitbit).

___
## Garmin

[Nightscout](https://nightscout.github.io/nightscout/new_user/) required.

- Forerunner or Fenix watches (Glucose Values, graphs)
- Garmin Edge cycle computers (Glucose Values)
- Internet connection and Nightscout needed

Please note that xDrip4iOS **does not** have an internal http server so you **will** need to pull data from Nightscout.

Once you have Nightscout running correctly, you will need to download **Garmin IQ** and **Garmin Connect** on your iPhone. Garmin IQ is used to download and configure the data field and Garmin Connect is used to send the data to your watch/Edge while you exercise.

You will then need to configure one of your sports profiles (Ebike, mountain bike, etc) to use the data field you configured in the previous step.
