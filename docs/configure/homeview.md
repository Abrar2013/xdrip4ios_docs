# Home Screen

At the top of the view you will find shortcut icons:

<img src="../img/SnoozeIcon.png" style="zoom:50%;" />	Snooze an [alarm](../../configure/alarms)

<img src="../img/StatusIcon.png" style="zoom:50%;" />	Display the sensor current status

<img src="../img/CalibrateIcon.png" style="zoom:50%;" />	[Calibrate](../../configure/calibrate/) your sensor

<img src="../img/LockIcon.png" style="zoom:50%;" />	[Lock](../../configure/#home-view) the display

<img src="../img/HelpIcon.png" style="zoom:50%;" />	Online [help](../../configure/#help)

Just below you'll see the current BG value and how long ago it was received by xDrip4iOS.  
On the right, the delta value refers to the difference between last and current measurement.  
The trend arrow is based on this delta value: it will not match Dexcom arrows (different calculation).

The central part is used by the graphical display, you can customize it as explained [here](../../configure/#home-view).  
You will also see [treatments](../treatments) if you added them or received them from Nightscout.

You can also change the time scale from 3 to 24 hours.

Below the graph you'll see your BG [statistics](../../configure/#statistics). They are defined using your [objective values](../../configure/#objective-values).  
You can display them on a timeframe ranging from one day (Today) to last 90 days.  
You can change HbA1c from % to mmol/l in your settings.  
You'll find more about these indicators [here](https://diatribe.org/understanding-average-glucose-standard-deviation-cv-and-blood-sugar-variability).

The pie chart is based on data present in xDrip4iOS (number of days below).

If you're using your phone in master mode, you will then see the sensor [lifetime](../../configure/#sensor-countdown) progress bar.

<img src="../img/SensorLife.png" style="zoom:46%;" />

You can set it to either increase (used days) or decrease (remaining days).
